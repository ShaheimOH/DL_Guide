# Deep Learning Guide

Artificial Intelligence (AI), and particularly Deep Learning (DL), has become a critical skill across many industries. However, due to the rapid pace of innovation, foundational concepts remain the most valuable for long-term learning.

This repository contains materials from the Deep Learning Guide authored by Dr. Shaheim Ogbomo-Harmitt, including a practical assignment designed to provide hands-on experience with deep learning, biomedical signal processing and model evaluation.
